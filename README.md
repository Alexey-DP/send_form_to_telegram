### Send form to telegram with only JS

The first thing we need is to create our bot. This is done quite simply. Type @botfather in the search, open the parent bot and click "Start".

Further:

We write the /newbot command to create a new bot.
Come up with a name for the bot.
Come up with a nickname for the bot.

If everything went well, you will see congratulations and your bot token.

Now you need to find your bot in the search by entering its nickname and click "Start" to activate it.

Go to the menu, click "New Group" and give your chat a name.
Don't forget to invite your bot to the chat.
At the moment we have a bot, we know its token, there is a chat where applications will come, and we only need to find out the chat id. To do this, write in the chat:

/join @name_bot

Substitute the token and chat_id in the function.
